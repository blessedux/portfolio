#About Me

Hey, I’m **Joaquín Farfán**, also known as **BlessedUX**.

I build **tools and experiences** that empower people to create, connect, and own what they build.  
I believe in **clarity, craftsmanship, and conviction** — that great design isn’t about trends, it’s abou **intuitive** relationships to the digital clones of our RWAs.

## 🌍 What I Do

I live at the intersection of **design, code, and money**.  
I create digital systems that feel **alive** — from decentralized finance protocols to AI companions and immersive experiences.  
Each project I touch shares the same DNA:

- **Meaningful utility.** It has to solve a real problem.
- **Aesthetic precision.** Beauty is not decoration — it’s discipline.
- **Human depth.** Technology should make us _more human_, not less.

I’ve led teams, launched products, organized communities, and built from zero more times than I can count.

## ⚡ Core Values

**Autonomy** — I create to stay free. I don’t wait for permission.  
**Mastery** — I’m obsessed with refining my craft, not chasing hype.  
**Integrity** — What I build has to _work_, _matter_, and _last_.  
**Vision** — I care more about the next decade than the next trend.  
**Humanity** — I don’t believe in tech for tech’s sake. I believe in people.

## My Philosophy

> “Design is not how it looks — it’s how it _feels to live inside it_.”

I’m building bridges between **AI, blockchain, and human experience**.  
My work is a continuous experiment in aligning code with consciousness —  
turning abstract systems into tangible realities that people can trust, touch, and love.
